# Project: CH32V003F4U6_Interface_with_OLED  

# Objective:  
Using the CH32V003F4U6 microcontroller to interface with an OLED display can be a fun and educational project. In this example, we will interface with a 128x64 OLED display using the I2C protocol.  

## 1. Components Needed  
CH32V003F4U6 Microcontroller  
128x64 OLED Display (I2C)  
Power Supply  
Resistors, Capacitors, and Wires  
Breadboard and Connectors  

## 2. Circuit Design  
OLED to CH32V003F4U6: Connect the I2C pins of the OLED display to the corresponding I2C pins of the CH32V003F4U6.  
SCL (Serial Clock Line): Connect to PB6 (I2C1_SCL)  
SDA (Serial Data Line): Connect to PB7 (I2C1_SDA)  
VCC: Connect to 3.3V or 5V depending on your OLED module.  
GND: Connect to GND.  

## 3. Software Implementation  
Initialize the I2C and OLED Display: Set up the I2C interface to communicate with the OLED display.  
Display Data on OLED: Write functions to send data to the OLED display and show text or graphics.  

## 4. Example Code  
Here's an example implementation in C:
