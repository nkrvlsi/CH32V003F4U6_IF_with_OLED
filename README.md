# Project: CH32V003F4U6_Interface_with_OLED  

# Objective:  
Using the CH32V003F4U6 microcontroller to interface with an OLED display can be a fun and educational project. In this example, we will interface with a 128x64 OLED display using the I2C protocol.  

## 1. Components Needed  
CH32V003F4U6 Microcontroller  
128x64 OLED Display (I2C)  
Power Supply  
Resistors, Capacitors, and Wires  
Breadboard and Connectors  

## 2. Circuit Design  
OLED to CH32V003F4U6: Connect the I2C pins of the OLED display to the corresponding I2C pins of the CH32V003F4U6.  
SCL (Serial Clock Line): Connect to PB6 (I2C1_SCL)  
SDA (Serial Data Line): Connect to PB7 (I2C1_SDA)  
VCC: Connect to 3.3V or 5V depending on your OLED module.  
GND: Connect to GND.  

## 3. Software Implementation  
Initialize the I2C and OLED Display: Set up the I2C interface to communicate with the OLED display.  
Display Data on OLED: Write functions to send data to the OLED display and show text or graphics.  

## 4. Example Code  
Here's an example implementation in C:  

## 5. Explanation  
### 5.1 I2C Initialization:  

1. Configures GPIO pins PB6 and PB7 for I2C communication.
2. Initializes I2C1 with a clock speed of 100kHz.

### 5.2 OLED Initialization:  

3. Sends a sequence of commands to initialize the OLED display (based on the SSD1306 controller).

### 5.3 OLED_WriteCommand:  

4. Sends a command byte to the OLED display over I2C.

### 5.4 OLED_WriteData:

5. Sends a data byte to the OLED display over I2C.

### 5.5 OLED_SetCursor:  

6. Sets the cursor position on the OLED display.

### 5.6 OLED_Clear:  

7. Clears the OLED display by writing 0x00 to all pixels.

### 5.7 OLED_DisplayString:  

8. Displays a string on the OLED screen by sending each character as data bytes.

### 5.8 setup:  

9. Initializes the I2C interface and the OLED display.
10. Clears the OLED display.
 
### 5.9 loop:

11. Displays a string "Hello, OLED!" on the OLED screen, waits for a second, clears the screen, and repeats.

## Notes
- **Font Data:** In this example, the OLED_DisplayString function directly sends character data, which assumes the OLED can interpret ASCII values. For a more complete implementation, include font data to convert characters to bitmaps.
- **Delays:** Ensure you have appropriate delay functions (delay and delayMicroseconds). If not available, implement them using timer interrupts.
- **OLED Address:** The OLED_ADDRESS might differ based on your OLED module. Check your moduleâ€™s datasheet for the correct address.
- **Optimizations:** For more efficient display updates, consider implementing a display buffer in RAM and sending the entire buffer to the OLED at once.
